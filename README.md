# Console-Finances

## Description

I created logic in JavaScript to analyse financial records. I used if statements and for loops to make this happen.

With the logic written I was able to print the values gotten on the console so others can read the financial records.

Now I know how for loops and if statements work.

The image below shows the result shown on the console when a user would like to access the financial resource.
